## Introduction
Course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone

In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst at a fictional company, Cyclistic. In order to answer the key business task of understanding how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently with the goal of designing a new marketing strategy to convert the casual riders to annual members. I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

The insights gained from this analysis will be used to develop targeted marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members, thereby increasing profitability and achieving Cyclistic's long-term growth objectives.

## Prepare
There are 12 files with naming convention of YYYYMM-divvy-tripdata and each file includes information for one month. The columns and data points that are provided within each file are ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id, start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng and member_casual.

## Process
**Steps Taken**
1. Extracting Data: Each zip file containing the bike-share data from September 2023 to August 2024 was intended to be extracted.
2. Loading Data into SQL Tables: Each monthâ€™s CSV file would be loaded into a separate SQL table named based on the year and month (e.g., 202309 for September 2023).
3. Combining Data: A new table named combined_cyclistic_data would be created by combining all individual monthly tables using the UNION ALL SQL command.
