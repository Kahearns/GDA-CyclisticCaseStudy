## Introduction
________________

In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst at a fictional company, Cyclistic. In order to answer the key business task of understanding how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently with the goal of designing a new marketing strategy to convert the casual riders to annual members. I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.
